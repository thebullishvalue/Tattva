## [2.1.0] — 2026-06-17 — *Multi-asset universe + robustness*

Minor release. Broadens the target universe well beyond commodities, retunes the
Aarambh ensemble from a study, hardens data fetching against rate limits, and
removes dead code. Backward compatible — no data-format or cache changes.

### Added
- **Equity-index targets** alongside commodities/FX: India broad & sectoral
  (Nifty 50/Next 50/100, Midcap 50, Smallcap 100, Bank, IT, Auto, FMCG, Pharma,
  Metal, Energy, Fin Services, Pvt/PSU Bank, Realty, Media, Infra, PSE, Consumption,
  Commodities, MNC, Services), US benchmarks (S&P 500, Nasdaq 100, Dow Jones), and an
  India sector-ETF universe. Each is its own Aarambh target with the index's own
  constituents as the Nirnay basket. (`INDEX_TARGETS` in `data/universe.py`.)
- **Snapshot fallbacks for S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100** — previously only Dow Jones had one,
  so the other two broke whenever the Wikipedia scrape was blocked.
- `lxml` and `html5lib` pinned in `requirements.txt` (parsers for the constituent scrape;
  `lxml` was previously only an implicit transitive dependency).

### Changed
- **Default ensemble `("ridge", "ols")` → `("ols", "huber")`.** An offline study across
  all six headline targets (Cotton/USD-INR/Nifty 50/Gold/Silver/Copper), scored by OOS
  rank-IC of the 10-day-forward forecast, found `ols+huber` best on both mean IC and
  worst-target robustness; the old `ridge+ols` ranked last (Ridge ≈ OLS on PCA-20).
- **No constituent cap by default** (`_DEFAULT_CAP` 40 → 0). Indices now use their full
  constituent set — capping a "Nifty 50" to 40 dropped real members. Re-enable by setting
  a positive cap.

### Fixed
- **Macro fetch column backfill.** yfinance rate-limits a few tickers per batch (e.g.
  `GC=F`, `BUNL.L`); the partial frame bypassed the all-or-nothing stale fallback and got
  cached, silently dropping a target column (Gold = `GC=F`) and failing the run with
  "Need 1500+ data points." Missing/all-NaN columns are now refilled from the most recent
  prior snapshot (scanning newest→oldest), re-healing the cache.

### Removed
- Dead code: `analytics/signals.py` (unused `MSFCalculator`/`MMRCalculator`, superseded by
  Nirnay's functional `calculate_msf`/`calculate_mmr`), `data/schema.py` +
  `build_unified_dataset` (uncalled Google-Sheet-era plumbing), and the unused
  `DEFAULT_PREDICTORS` / `DEFAULT_SHEET_URL` config constants.

### Docs
- **Single source of truth for the version.** `VERSION`/`PRODUCT_NAME`/`COMPANY` now live
  only in `core/config.py`; `ui/theme.py` re-exports them (ends the recurring config↔theme
  drift). Removed the duplicated `vX.Y.Z` token from every module-header docstring.
- README and docstrings corrected from "commodity-only" to the multi-asset reality, and
  the ensemble description updated to the configurable default; stale Google-Sheet /
  "Nifty 50 PE" references removed.

## [2.0.0] — 2026-06-11 — *Tattva — Commodity Convergence*

Major release. The system pivots from a Sheets-fed Nifty 50 PE valuation tool to
a **single-source (yfinance) commodity convergence engine** for **Gold, Silver,
and Copper**, and is renamed **Nishkarsh → Tattva** (तत्त्व, "principle/essence").
This is a breaking change: data source, target universe, model formulation, on-disk
cache/profile location, and product identity all change.

### Added
- **User-selectable commodity target** (Gold / Silver / Copper) in the sidebar; each
  keys its own calibrated intelligence profile.
- **Predictive Aarambh engine.** Forecasts the forward 10-day return from trailing
  20-day macro momentum (ex-ante), driving a directional conviction signal.
- **Causal per-window PCA** inside the walk-forward ensemble (≈20 components) — keeps
  all ~112 inputs "on" while stabilising the ensemble; fit per training window so it
  never repaints.
- **Walk-forward validation** (purged, expanding-window, re-calibrated per window) that
  runs automatically each analysis and renders in the Diagnostics tab — a durability
  grade distinguishing real edge from a lucky regime.
- **Per-commodity Nirnay baskets** of related miners/streamers (pure single names).
- Curated macro universe expansion (equities, volatility, EM/China, sector and
  real-asset ETFs) usable as predictors.

### Changed
- **Renamed the product Nishkarsh → Tattva** across UI, console, docstrings, cache dir
  (`~/.cache/tattva`), and profile version (`v1-tattva-convergence`).
- **Directional convergence score.** The cross-validator score now carries the consensus
  direction, so the hero card and DDM no longer contradict each other in sign.
- **Robustified Intelligence calibration:** purged **k-fold CV objective** + a held-out
  tail (replaces the single 70/30 split), stronger L2 — eliminates single-slice overfit.
- Aarambh now models **log-returns**, not price levels (ends the spurious levels regression).
- Diagnostics tab reordered by decision priority (edge metrics first); Feature Impact
  compacted to top-15.

### Removed
- **Google Sheets ingestion** and all sheet/secret plumbing — the system is now pure yfinance.
- Predictive-mode metrics that were misleading (R²-vs-RW, OU/Hurst on the forecast series)
  removed from the cards/console in favour of Val IC.

### Performance
- Aarambh phase ~**4× faster** (≈3.5 min → ≈50 s) via the causal PCA dimensionality cut.

## [1.4.0] — 2026-05-27 — *Self-Calibrating Convergence*

Headline release: **Intelligence Mode** is now the default pipeline path —
auto-calibrated profiles applied on every Run Analysis in a single flow, with
the progress bar and sidebar rewritten to expose the new behaviour clearly.

### Added
- **Intelligence-aware progress bar.** The CONVERGENCE phase now surfaces its
  sub-stages explicitly so users can see what the calibration loop is doing:
  - `83%` First-Pass Conviction Model (DDM filter · prior weights)
  - `84%` Intelligence Mode · Setup (tuner build · 70/30 split · N trials)
  - `84 → 90%` Intelligence Mode · Calibrating (live Optuna trial counter
    and best score)
  - `90%` Intelligence Mode · Profile Saved (Train IC · Val IC)
  - `91%` Applying Calibrated Profile (vectorized re-weight)
  - `92%` Re-Fitting Conviction Model (post-calibration DDM pass)
  - `93%` Detecting Divergences
  - `94%` Convergence Phase Complete (with `calibrated profile applied`
    or `factory defaults` suffix so the user can see which path ran)
  - `95%` Storing Results · `100%` Analysis Complete
  When Intelligence Mode is OFF, the `84–92%` band is skipped end-to-end.

### Changed
- **Progress bar typography** — every progress label and subtitle migrated
  to Title Case for consistency across the pipeline.
- **Sidebar rhythm tightened.** The vertical gap between consecutive setting
  groups (Data Source ↔ Model Configuration ↔ Model Passport ↔ System Spec)
  reduced from `1.5rem` / `3rem` to `0.5–0.75rem` so the right rail reads
  as a compact toolset rather than three scattered panels:
  - `.section-divider` margin: `var(--sp-6)` → `var(--sp-3)` (globally);
    `var(--sp-2)` inside `[data-testid="stSidebar"]`.
  - `.sidebar-title` margin: `var(--sp-6) 0 var(--sp-3) 0` →
    `var(--sp-3) 0 var(--sp-2) 0`.
  - Pre-`system-spec` `<hr>` margin: `3.00rem 0` → `1rem 0 0.75rem 0`.
- **Reset Analysis** button uses `use_container_width=True` — full-width like
  Export Profile and Reset to Defaults below it in the Model Passport.

### Docs
- README now reflects the Intelligence Mode pipeline as the default flow:
  new `Intelligence Mode` section explaining what gets calibrated, the
  Optuna-TPE objective, and the per-universe profile persistence path.
- Pipeline-flow diagram updated to include the **Phase 4 calibration loop**
  (first-pass → tuner → apply → re-fit).
- `What You See` table now lists the Intelligence Center and Model Passport.
- Configuration table notes the Intelligence Mode toggle and trial count.
- Module headers and version constants unified at **`v1.4.0`** across all
  Python files, `requirements.txt`, `README.md`, `LICENSE.md`, and CHANGELOG.

## [1.3.0] — 2026-05-26 — *Resilient Convergence*

Production-grade data layer, refactored convergence wiring, self-calibrating
**Intelligence Mode**, and full UI parity with the sibling **Pragyam** terminal.

### Added (Intelligence Mode — new in this release)
- **Self-calibrating convergence profile.** New module `convergence/intelligence.py`
  ports Sanket's Bayesian-TPE calibration pattern to Nishkarsh's convergence
  layer. An Optuna search finds the per-universe optimum for:
  - Four dimension weights (`w_direction`, `w_breadth`, `w_magnitude`, `w_regime`)
    used inside `CrossValidator.compute_convergence`, replacing the static
    `0.30 / 0.25 / 0.25 / 0.20` defaults and the ±10% adaptive shift heuristic.
  - Four asymmetric classification thresholds (`buy_strong`, `buy_moderate`,
    `sell_moderate`, `sell_strong`) used inside `convergence/normalization.py`
    `classify_normalized_signal`, replacing the symmetric ±0.3 / ±0.5 defaults.
- **Calibration objective:** maximize the Spearman Information Ratio of the
  composite convergence signal against forward NIFTY-50-PE returns at
  horizons `[3, 5, 10, 20]` trading days, with L2 regularization toward
  uniform weights to discourage overfit. Validates via a chronological
  70/30 train/val split (no shuffling — preserves causality).
- **Disk persistence** at `~/.cache/nishkarsh/intelligence/profiles.json`,
  one profile per `(universe · selected_index)` key, with versioning
  (`PROFILE_VERSION = "v1-nishkarsh-convergence"`).
- **Sidebar "Model Passport" card** ported faithfully from Sanket
  (`_render_model_passport_sidebar` in `app.py`). Shows Default / Calibrated
  / Calibrated · ⚠ profile state, Trained-on label, Train IC, Val IC, last
  updated timestamp, plus universe-mismatch warnings, an Import / Export /
  Reset control group, and an **Intelligence Mode toggle** (default ON).
- **Intelligence Center** section in the Diagnostics tab — read-only
  diagnostic dashboard surfacing Train IC, Val IC, Stability %, Trials,
  learned-weights bar chart (calibrated vs default), threshold values,
  Optuna fANOVA factor sensitivity, and a list of all saved profiles
  on disk. No calibrate button — calibration is auto-triggered by
  Run Analysis (see below).
- **Single-flow auto-calibration.** The `CONVERGENCE` phase of every
  Run Analysis now runs the full calibration loop end-to-end with no
  manual user input:
  1. First-pass `CrossValidator` with the **prior profile** (loaded from
     disk for this universe, or factory defaults if none exists).
  2. Initial `UnifiedConvictionModel` fit to populate the convergence
     time-series (which the calibrator needs as its input).
  3. **Auto-calibration** — `ConvergenceTuner` runs Optuna TPE on the
     fresh `convergence_df` + `aarambh_ts`, with live progress on the
     pipeline progress bar (85% → 90%) and per-trial console output.
  4. **Apply in same run** — `intelligence.apply_calibrated_weights()`
     does vectorized recomputation of `convergence_score` and
     `convergence_zone` from the existing `dim_*` columns and the
     newly-learned weights (no need to re-loop CrossValidator).
  5. **Conviction model re-fit** on the recomputed scores, so the
     final DDM-filtered conviction reflects the calibrated state.
  6. **Normalized convergence** classified with the calibrated
     asymmetric thresholds.
  7. **Profile persisted** to disk so the next run starts from this
     calibration (warm path), and the **Passport sidebar updates** on
     the post-analysis rerun to show the freshly-saved profile.

  When the Intelligence Mode toggle is OFF, steps 3–5 are skipped —
  the system runs on factory defaults end-to-end (this is also the
  fall-back if calibration raises an exception).

### Dependencies
- Added `optuna>=3.5.0` to `requirements.txt` for the Bayesian TPE search.

### Added
- **Smart data layer.** Three production-grade primitives now sit between the
  app and every external API:
  - **Circuit breaker** (`data/circuit_breaker.py`) — `CLOSED → OPEN → HALF_OPEN`
    state machine per service, thread-safe, with two module-level breakers
    (`yfinance_circuit`, `sheets_circuit`) and a shared `all_circuits()` helper.
  - **Retry-with-backoff** — exponential decorator (1s → 2s → 4s, capped at 60s,
    max 3 retries), `@yfinance_circuit.protect` / `@RetryWithBackoff` stack.
  - **Two-tier cache** (`data/cache.py`, revived from dead code) — memory + disk,
    TTL expiry, **versioned keys** (`version="v1"` bump invalidates a namespace
    atomically), `get_stale()` last-good-snapshot fallback used automatically
    when a fetch fails *and* the circuit is open, full `stats()` snapshot
    (hits / misses / stale_hits / writes / hit_rate / namespace / TTL).
- **Data Layer Health diagnostics** — new section in the Diagnostics tab
  showing per-namespace cache hit rate, disk entry count, last-fetch
  timestamp, and per-service circuit-breaker state (CLOSED / HALF-OPEN / OPEN).
- **Global Macro bond-ETF universe.** Ported from the sibling **Sanket**
  project — 66 yfinance-available bond ETF tickers covering US Treasuries
  (full curve + raw yields ^IRX / ^FVX / ^TNX / ^TYX), TIPS, aggregate
  bonds, corporate IG / HY, mortgage-backed, municipals, developed-markets
  sovereign (Europe + Asia-Pacific), India fixed income, and emerging
  markets. Replaces the broken Stooq endpoints.
- **Shared normalisation module** (`convergence/normalization.py`) — single
  source of truth for the math behind the Convergence Analysis cards *and*
  the Unified Signal plot. Five small pure functions:
  `align_aarambh_nirnay`, `compute_norm_params`, `zscore_clip`,
  `classify_normalized_signal`, `compute_normalized_convergence`.
- **Pragyam-style UI uplift.** Full port of the *Obsidian Quant Terminal*
  design system from Pragyam:
  - `ui/theme.css` expanded from 47KB to 114KB — adds backdrop-filter glass,
    SVG noise + grid underlays, 11+ entrance / shimmer / gradient-shift
    keyframes, premium springy easing `cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1)`,
    expanded palette (`--orange`, `--slate-warm`, `--card-base` DRY tokens).
  - `ui/components.py` expanded from 18KB to 27KB — new helpers
    `get_icon(name, size, stroke_width)` (dynamic-sized SVG), `get_signal_badge`
    (5-tier conviction badge), `render_conviction_signal`, `render_system_card`,
    `render_kv_table`. Icon library grew from 18 → 34.
  - Signal card design language unified with metric cards: corner accent dot
    + bottom gradient sweep + tinted background gradients per variant.
  - **Equal-height metric cards** — replaced the brittle `height: 100%` cascade
    with a `flex: 1 1 auto` propagation that's robust against Streamlit DOM
    changes (e.g. inserted `stVerticalBlock` wrappers).
- **System info card** in the sidebar — adopts Pragyam's `system-spec` markup
  with `.spec-row` / `.spec-label` / `.spec-value` flex layout (replaces the
  earlier `info-box` paragraph version).

### Changed
- **Convergence Analysis cards re-wired to the Unified Signal plot.** The four
  metric cards now show *exactly* what the Unified Signal plot rows display:
  - **NISHKARSH CONVICTION** ← normalized convergence (`norm_avg[-1]` in
    `[−1, +1]`), formatted `+0.42`. Signal classification re-thresholded for
    the new scale (`±0.3` moderate, `±0.5` strong).
  - **AARAMBH CONVICTION** ← `aarambh_ts["ConvictionRaw"]` (was
    `ConvictionBounded`), formatted `+0.42`.
  - **NIRNAY AVG SIGNAL** ← unchanged source, format upgraded from 1 to
    2 decimal places.
  - **AGREEMENT** ← unchanged.
- **Hero signal card** (`_render_primary_signal` in `app.py`) now reads the
  normalized value too. Interpretation paragraph rewritten to surface
  Aarambh and Nirnay contributions independently.
- **`render_nishkarsh_signal_card`** conviction format changed from `:+.0f`
  to `:+.2f` to render the new `[−1, +1]` scale meaningfully.
- **Sidebar masthead** typography tightened to match Pragyam exactly
  (`1.35rem` brand size, `0.04em` letter-spacing, `<hr>` divider instead of
  `.section-divider`).

### Removed
- **Stooq direct-yield endpoints.** Stooq started returning HTML error pages
  instead of CSV in late 2025, causing a cascade of `ParserError` retry
  loops. Replaced wholesale with the Global Macro yfinance universe.
- **`MACRO_SYMBOLS_STOOQ`** and dead **`MACRO_COLUMN_MAP`** removed from
  `core/config.py`.
- **`stooq_circuit`** breaker removed — no longer reachable.

### Fixed
- **DataFrame fragmentation `PerformanceWarning`** in `engines/nirnay.py` —
  two batches of column-by-column assignments (12 + 6 columns) collapsed into
  single `df.assign(...)` calls. `Series.shift(1)` replaced with
  `np.concatenate(([nan], arr[:-1]))` to keep behaviour byte-identical
  (verified on a 5-element test sequence).
- **Metric tooltip ring/dot misalignment** — the `::before` glow dot and the
  `.metric-tooltip` help-circle were both anchored at `top: var(--sp-3); right:
  var(--sp-3)`, but their centres differed by 3px each axis. Tooltip now has
  explicit `width/height: 12px` and adjusted position so the ring is
  concentric with the dot.
- **Header text alignment** inside metric cards — the equal-height flex rule
  was inadvertently forcing `flex-direction: column` on `<h4>`, which combined
  with the inherited `align-items: center` to horizontally centre the label.
  Narrowed the flex propagation selector to `div`-only descendants.
- **Sanskrit name on the landing page** — `.premium-header h1::after` content
  was still "प्रज्ञम" (left over from the Pragyam CSS port); corrected to
  "निष्कर्ष".

### Performance
- **Macro fetch concurrency** is now driven by yfinance's internal `threads=True`
  pool — one batch call for all 84 unique macro tickers (66 Global Macro +
  18 commodities/FX), one circuit hit, no manual `ThreadPoolExecutor` loop.

### Docs
- Module headers and version constants unified at **`v1.3.0`** across all
  35 Python files, `requirements.txt`, `README.md`, `LICENSE.md`, and the
  CHANGELOG.
- `data/cache.py`, `data/circuit_breaker.py`, and `convergence/normalization.py`
  carry full module-level docstrings explaining the lifecycle, state machine,
  and pipeline respectively.

---

## [1.2.0] — 2026-04-13 — *Obsidian Quant Terminal*

Full standardisation pass: module headers, documentation, and system integrity fixes.

### Added
- **Standardised module headers** across all 33 Python files. Every module now carries
  the `Nishkarsh v1.2.0` header with the निष्कर्ष tagline and a system-level description
  (AARAMBH, NIRNAY, CONVERGENCE, DATA, ANALYTICS, UI, CORE).
- **Structural break fallback** — `BaiPerronTest` is only in unreleased statsmodels 0.15+.
  A rolling-mean change-point heuristic is now used as a fallback when the native
  implementation is unavailable.

### Changed
- **UI aesthetic** rewritten as *"Obsidian Quant Terminal"* design language:
  - **Typography:** Syne (geometric, authoritative) for display, JetBrains Mono for data.
  - **Palette:** Obsidian (#0A0E17 → #050810), Amber Gold (#D4A853),
    Cyan (#22D3EE), Emerald (#34D399), Rose (#FB7185).
  - **Surfaces:** Frameless glass panels with thin border strokes.
  - **Plotly defaults** centralised in `ui/theme.py` — single source of truth for
    font, grid, hover, legend, and margin config across all tab renderers.
- **`VERSION` unified** — `ui/theme.py` VERSION corrected from `3.1.0` to `1.2.0`
  to match `core/config.py`. All module headers now reference `v1.2.0`.
- **`README.md`** rewritten from scratch with Obsidian Quant Terminal branding,
  full architecture diagram, pipeline flow, and troubleshooting section.
- **`CHANGELOG.md`** restructured — removed legacy Aarambh-only version entries
  that predate the Nishkarsh unification.

### Fixed
- **statsmodels compatibility** — `BaiPerronTest` import no longer crashes on
  statsmodels 0.14.x. Graceful fallback to heuristic detection.
- **VERSION consistency** — `core/config.py` (`1.2.0`) and `ui/theme.py` (`3.1.0`)
  now both report `1.2.0`.

---

## [1.1.0] — 2026-04-07 — *Nishkarsh Production Release*

The first release under the **Nishkarsh** name. Replaces the prior
"Samyoga" branding and ships the unified two-system convergence engine
end-to-end.

### Added
- **Unified Convergence Engine.** Two orthogonal systems (Aarambh top-down +
  Nirnay bottom-up) merged into a single convergence pipeline with adaptive
  4-dimension scoring (Direction 30% · Breadth 25% · Magnitude 25% · Regime 20%).
- **Cross-system divergence detection.** Three event types:
  - `AARAMBH_LEADS` — valuation extreme, constituents lagging (early warning).
  - `NIRNAY_LEADS` — momentum-first move (breadth turning before valuation).
  - `CONTRADICTION` — persistent disagreement (uncertain regime).
- **Terminal logging system** — direct console output with timed phases,
  per-constituent analysis logs, and formatted run summaries.
- **Progressive UI** — animated pulse-dot progress cards with gradient bar
  and real-time status during pipeline execution.
- **Nifty 50 constituent analysis.** All 50 symbols processed through
  MSF + MMR + the four-method regime ensemble (Adaptive Kalman / 3-state HMM /
  GARCH-like / CUSUM), aggregated to daily breadth statistics.
- **Macro data integration.** 18 yfinance commodities/FX symbols + 6 bond
  yields from Google Sheets = 24 macro indicators feeding the MMR regression.
- **Timeframe filtering.** 3M / 6M / 1Y / 2Y / ALL buttons with synchronised
  x-axis zoom across all convergence charts.
- **Hover templates.** All Plotly charts show date + value tooltips.

### Changed
- **System renamed** from *Samyoga* to **Nishkarsh** (निष्कर्ष — *"Conclusion"*).
  Complete branding update across every file.
- **Default timeframe** is now 6M (was 1Y); 3M added (replacing 1M).
- **Sigmoid formula** corrected to the original Nirnay form
  `2 / (1 + exp(−x / scale)) − 1` (was `2 / (1 + exp(−scale·x)) − 1`).
- **Market markers** on the unified signal plot now use conviction-plot-style
  markers (size 7/8/10 by signal strength, colour-coded green/red/grey).
- **Nirnay tab** completely rewritten to match the original Nirnay charts:
  oversold/overbought distribution, raw counts, buy/sell signal counts,
  HMM regime probabilities.

### Fixed
- **Stooq bond yields fallback.** Integrated Google Sheets bond yields
  (IN10Y / IN02Y / IN30Y / US10Y / US30Y / US02Y) when Stooq blocks
  automated access.
- **Column-name normalisation.** All Nirnay aggregation outputs use exact
  original column names (`Oversold_Pct`, `Overbought_Pct`, `Buy_Signals`, …).
- **Convergence date alignment.** Proper inner-join between Aarambh
  calendar dates and Nirnay trading dates.
- **Warning suppression.** Silenced yfinance, urllib3, pandas, and numpy
  warnings for clean terminal output.

### Removed
- All `Samyoga` branding references (sidebar, headers, signal cards,
  console output, metric cards).
- Progress-bar jargon — replaced with clean progress cards.
- Dead code paths from multi-phase development iterations.

---

## [1.0.0] — 2026-04-05 — *Initial Nishkarsh Release*

The first unified Nishkarsh release, inheriting the Aarambh-only lineage.

### Added
- **Aarambh FairValueEngine** — walk-forward ensemble regression (Ridge / Huber /
  OLS / ElasticNet / PCA-WLS) on Nifty 50 PE ratio with conformal prediction
  intervals and DDM smoothing.
- **Nirnay constituent engine** — per-stock MSF + MMR with four-method regime
  ensemble (Adaptive Kalman / 3-state HMM / GARCH-like / CUSUM).
- **Convergence cross-validator** — 4-dimension adaptive scoring with
  Drift-Diffusion filtering and divergence classification.
- **Streamlit UI** — five-tab interface with Obsidian Quant Terminal styling,
  timeframe filtering, and CSV export.
- **Google Sheets + yfinance data pipeline** — unified fetcher with TTL caching.
- **Nifty 50 live constituent fetching** from niftyindices.com with Wikipedia fallback.

### Inherited from Aarambh lineage (pre-unification)

The following mathematical foundations were hardened during the Aarambh-only
development cycle (versions 2.0.0–3.2.2) and carried forward:

- **True conformal quantiles** — empirical `compute_conformal_zscores` replacing
  pseudo-Gaussian z-scores.
- **Bai-Perron regime binding** — expanding windows bound to the most recent
  structural break.
- **DDM variance capping** — geometric variance scaling to prevent ballooning
  standard errors during prolonged regimes.
- **Andrews (1993) median-unbiased AR(1)** — jackknife correction for near-unit-root.
- **DFA Hurst exponent** — Peng et al. (1994) replacing biased R/S estimator.
- **Look-ahead bias elimination** — rolling mean/std with `shift(1)`.
- **Conviction soft bounds** — `tanh` transformation to `[−100, +100]`.
- **Thread-safe walk-forward** — lock-protected sequential execution.
