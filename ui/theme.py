Tattva — Shared CSS, chart theming, and color constants for the UI layer.
तत्त्व (Tattva) — "Principle / Essence"

UI — Institutional research terminal design language.

Aesthetic: "Graphite" — near-achromatic ground, semantic colour only
--------------------------------------------------------------------
- Display/UI:  Inter (prose, headings, labels)
- Body/Data:   JetBrains Mono (tabular numerals — every figure in the app)
- Ground:      Graphite (#0A0C10 -> #1C212A), deliberately neutral. The
               previous ramp was a saturated navy, which tinted every panel
               and forced the semantic hues to shout over a coloured field.
- Semantic:    Cobalt #4C7DF0 (interactive), Green #2CA36B (long),
               Red #DD5A5A (short), Amber #D79A3C (caution ONLY),
               Steel #4E9FC4 (info). Muted, not the stock Tailwind-500 ramp;
               each clears WCAG AA on every surface it is used on.
- Surfaces:    Flat, told apart by a hairline border and one step of tone.
               No blur, no stacked shadows — a shadow is spent on overlays.
- Themes:      Slate (dark, canonical) and Paper (light, for reading and
               print). The light theme is a token swap, not a second
               stylesheet — see LIGHT_TOKENS below.
